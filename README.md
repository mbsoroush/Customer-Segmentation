# Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the practice of categorizing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, enabling companies to target and tailor their marketing strategies to each group effectively. Customers are typically segmented based on their similarities in behavior, preferences, and purchasing habits.

The main task of clustering is to identify natural groups within an unlabeled dataset. This means that clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task, which is important in many scientific, engineering, and business domains.

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation for a shopping mall using machine learning algorithms. This is an unsupervised clustering problem.
